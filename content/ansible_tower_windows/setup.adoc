= Workshop Lab Setup

image::tower.002.png['Tower']

== Setup

[IMPORTANT]
- Today's workshop infrastructure is being run in the Cloud (either Amazon EC2, VMWare, or Azure).

- Each student will have three instances to use.  Connectivity details will be provided by the instructor.

- Central Active Directory, DNS, and GitLab environments are utilized in this workshop.

== Workshop Infrastructure

Each student's personal lab is equipped with the following:

* (1) Control node (Linux host to run ansible plays and install Ansible Tower).
** Red Hat Enterprise 7
* (1) Windows Workstation (to interact with the environment, edit code, etc).
** Windows 2012/2016
* (1) Windows Endpoint nodes (to execute ansible playbooks upon).
** Windows 2012/2016
* Ansible Engine 2.5
* Ansible Tower 3.3

== Testing your environment

Log into your workstation instance with an RDP client using the details provided by your instructor.  You will see a few things pre-installed for use today:

* Firefox
* Chrome
* Visual Studio Code (Editor for creating playbooks)
* Git (Source Code Control)

[IMPORTANT]
Be sure you can log in to your workstation instances.  If you can't log in start shouting, loudly, and waving your hands!  We will test access to the other hosts in the first exercise.

== End Result

At this point, everyone should have logged into your workstation node.  If you haven't, let us know so we can get you fixed up.
